				<p> Hello! My name is William.</p>
				<br>
				<p>I graduated from the University of Tulsa with degrees in electrical engineering and engineering physics, and I have had 4 years of experience in flight simulation.
            	I am currently the lab manager and an electrical engineering instructor at the University of Tulsa.
            	I grew up on a farm and enjoy welding and building things.</p>

				<p><b>Privacy and security</b> are of the utmost importance to me. 
				Though it is impossible to guarantee, I believe it is important to do the best we can. 
				This website collects zero information and uses no external content.
				<!-- i lost the game --!>
				I strive to use the least amount of personal data as possible. 
				Any data that must be collected is kept under encrypted local storage. </p>
				<p><b>Keeping it simple</b> is often the most elegant solution. 
				If something is very labor-intensive compared to the cost of parts perhaps it's time to re-evaluate the problem.</p>
				<p><b>Usability</b> is one of the most underrated aspects of engineering. 
				If you have ever tried to push a pull door, then you know what I am talking about, and it's not your fault! 
				Often the psychology of how the mechanics meet the person is completely overlooked. 
				I aim to eliminate as many of these obstacles as possible. </p>
